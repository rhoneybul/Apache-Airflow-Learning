# Apache-Airflow-Learning

This repository contains exercises I went through while learning how to use Apache Airflow

## Getting Started

To start the apache airflow webserver, and corresponding database, use `docker-compose up -d`.

The DAGS are contained in the dags folder, which is subsequently volume mounted to the airflow system.
